Using Git & GitHub
==============

You will need to be familiar with Git to function at all in this world.

Git Bash
--------

  Open Git Bash and navigate to your projects directory (if you don't know how to do this or want to make a projects directory, see the Linux reference). For our first trick, let's make a clone of the Template project to work on.

  For our next trick, we'll be breaking the git header so we can freely edit this as an entirely new repository.

  Now we can turn this into a Git Repository on our local machine and push it up to GitHub!




GitHub
------

  Check a look at that GitHub. V Nice.
