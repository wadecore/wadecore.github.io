Getting Started
===============

This section is mostly just a description of the tools you'll be using, laid out in the order that they're used in the workflow. Keep this in mind.

Linux
-----

You will not be required to use linux in this process unless you need to compile sphinx documents from scratch. You will, however, need to know basic linux terminal bash commands to move forward. I've already compiled the Template document, you should only need to edit that in your favorite text editor.

Sphinx
------

`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license. We use this as the backend for all of our documents. You will need to learn the reStructuredText markup. If you'd like to know more, visit the Formatting in Sphinx Section. The Template document was generated in Sphinx, utilizing the readthedocs theme.

Git & GitHub
------------

`Git <https://git-scm.com>`_ is a version control standard, and `GitHub <http://github.com>`_ is a project hosting platform designed specifically to work with Git. You will need to use Git Bash to add any documentation to GitHub. See the Using Git & GitHub section for details.

Readthedocs
-----------

`Readthedocs.org <http://readthedocs.org>`_ is the hosting platform for all of the InterbotiX manuals. This site will allow you to compile the sphinx markup from the github repository into its final form as a front-facing document. See the Using Readthedocs.org section to handle the final steps of the process.
